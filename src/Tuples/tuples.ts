//Tuples are exclusive to TS and is an array of fixed lengths and ordered with specific types- like super rigid arrays
let myTuple: [number, string]
myTuple = [10, "myString"]
//cannot do myTuple = ["myString", 10]
const numberArr: [number, number, number] = [255, 255, 255]

//you can .push on tuples arrays or even .pop a tuples array
